abstract = {Process mining (PM) aims to construct, from event logs, process maps that can help discover, automate, improve, and monitor organizational processes. Robotic process automation (RPA) uses software robots to perform some tasks usually executed by humans. It is usually difficult to determine what processes and steps to automate, especially with RPA. PM is seen as one way to address such difficulty. This paper aims to assess the applicability of process mining in accelerating and improving the implementation of RPA, along with the challenges encountered throughout project lifecycle. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the approaches where PM techniques were used to understand the as-is processes that can be automated with software robots. Seven databases were used to identify papers on this topic. A total of 32 papers, all published since 2018, were selected from 605 unique candidate papers and then analyzed. There is a steady increase in the number of publications in this domain, especially during the year 2022, which suggests a raising interest in the combined use of PM with RPA. The literature mainly focuses on the methods to record the events that occur at the level of user interactions with the application, and on the preprocessing methods that are needed to discover routines with the steps that can be automated. Important challenges are faced with preprocessing such event logs, and many lifecycle steps of automation projects are weakly supported by existing approaches suggesting corresponding research areas in need of further attention.}

abstract = {The challenges of tackling increasing caseloads, large volumes of digital data and maintaining examination efficiency in order to adhere to tight criminal justice system deadlines persist. As the field looks towards techniques for improving efficiency, forms of automation are both simultaneously touted as a potential solution, whilst also attracting criticism. The potential for techniques which mechanise parts of the digital forensic examination process, and do it reliably, is great, however developing the capability to do this remains a challenge. This work provides an introductory discussion to Robotic Process Automation, a form of service task automation. Its potential application is debated and two case studies are offered demonstrating potential areas of applicability. An objective evaluation is offered, debating whether technology has a place in improving efficiency in this field.}
